# ShowHide
ShowHide is a limited Fences Alternative in that it allows you to "Show" or "Hide" your desktop icons. (No "fences" can be created with this, but I always used the show/hide feature WAY more anyway)

It was originally hosted on zardssoftware.ml (which is offline now) and can be found in only a few online archives if you know EXACTLY what you're looking for.

The last known version was ShowHide 2.2, which is hosted here. 

If anyone can reverse engineer this excellent work, we can build on it and keep it current and free like it was before.
