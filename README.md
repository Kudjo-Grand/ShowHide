# ShowHide
ShowHide is a limited Fences Alternative in that it allows you to "Show" or "Hide" your desktop icons. (No "fences" can be created with this, but I always used the show/hide feature WAY more anyway) An Open Source Fences Alternative that aims to recreate the "fences" feature can be found here (still under development): https://github.com/Twometer/NoFences

It was originally hosted on zardssoftware.ml (which is offline now) and can be found in only a few online archives if you know EXACTLY what you're looking for.

The last known version was ShowHide 2.2, which is hosted here: https://github.com/Kudjo-Grand/ShowHide/archive/refs/tags/2.2.zip. 

It is a single executable, portable (no dependencies), and has a system tray control panel that allows the user to do several things on a right-click, such as:
- toggle Show/Hide of desktop icons 
- choose if it starts with Windows
- select a HotKey that can be used to toggle Show/Hide of desktop icons
- disable/enable ShowHide

Double-clicking the system tray icon will:
- toggle Show/Hide of desktop icons 
- change the system tray icon to reflect if icons are currently being Shown or Hidden

If anyone can reverse engineer this excellent work, we can build on it and keep it current and free like it was before. Perhaps we could add in the ability to double-click a blank spot on the Desktop to toggle Show/Hide of desktop icons.
